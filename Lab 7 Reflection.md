# Lab 6 reflection

  
I found the first excerise straight forward because it was just java. it was nice how it was seperated into their own functions. 
<br>
The second excerise was just a matter of looking at the documentation on how DateTime worked, and the different formatting string things to get the right string format.
<br>
The third excerice was straight forward, even though it was confusing with all the brackets and objects with within arrays.
