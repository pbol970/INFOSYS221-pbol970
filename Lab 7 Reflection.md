# Lab 6 reflection
<p>
  
  I found the first excerise straight forward because it was just java. it was nice how it was seperated into their own functions. 
  The second excerise was just a matter of looking at the documentation on how DateTime worked, and the different formatting string things to get the right string format.
  the third excerice was straight forward, even though it was confusing with all the brackets and objects with within arrays.
