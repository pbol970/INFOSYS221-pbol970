# Assignment 2 Reflection


<p>
  I found the assignment more difficult than it needed to be. I couldve accomplished the same outcome without having to use 4 classes. I think the use of the classes is a good idea but I think it was a bit overkill. I did manage to complete this assingment reletivly quickly because iv had past experience with coding.
  
  Other than that, I did struggle passing the player object around and having issues with passing by value and passing by reference.
