# lab 6 refelction
<p>
  I found this lab pretty straight forward and easy to understand. 
  I am pretty comfortable with python, but im not so comfortable with javascript and need to look up certain things now and then.
  I will prob need to refreash myself on Javascript. 
  
  But other than that, I found the lab and this week in general straight and easy to understand.
