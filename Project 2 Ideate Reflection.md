## Project 2 - Ideate

<p>
At the start, we split up into 2 groups, I partnered with Ethan to work on Google AppSheets. I found it surpisingly confusing to create an app from scratch. I wouldve thought that google being google, it would be easy and straight forward. I also found it very hard to customize the views and import the data correctly. 
Ethan and I spent quite a bit of time trying to see how the app making process worked.
we spent about 2 hours on this process.

We also had 3 group meetings, which the first one was about who would take what noCode platform. the second one was the brainstorming session, which we did online and got some good ideas about our app. The third meeting was about us coming together and discussing our findings with out noCode plateform. we came to the conclusion that Microsoft PowerApps were a better option moving forward. 

Besides figuring out how Google Appsheet worked, everything else was straight forward.
