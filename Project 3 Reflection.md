# INFOSYS 221 Project 3 Reflection

<p>
I found this project assignment straight forward, we all chose 1 section of the app to draw on paper to get a rough idea of what we want the app to look like. we then posted a picture of our drawing on the shared google doc. we had a rough total of 3 hours of group meets deciding what we should and any considerations for the final app.
  
I personally found using microsoft powerapps a lot better than google appsheets because it was more customisable and easier to make the app according to the drawings. I enjoyed using powerapps as its similar to other tools iv used such as adobe XD and easier to get the idea across.

we also had spent some time together as a group discussing any potential problems with making the final version of our app and came to conclusion that we didnt have much considerations to think about.
