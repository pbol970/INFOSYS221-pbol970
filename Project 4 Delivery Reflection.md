# Project 4 Delivery Reflection


This final project delivery was probably the hardest section in the project saga. We mostly struggled with using powerapps and making it work to our desired specifications. we later realised in the project development that it was impossible to implement some core features due to the limitations of the free microsoft powerapp version we were running. For example, the search feature in the search screen was a paid component of PowerApps and couldnt be implemented. We also used a Excel spreedsheet to store our data. but this made it impossible to edit and change the excel spreedsheet via the app inferface. If we used a different storage solution we couldve managed to make this feature functional. But we didnt do this as we didnt know what other storage solution to use, let alone how to use it. Because we havnt been taught how to use powerapps or appSheets in class, it was impossible to implement these features. 

As we were using Microsoft powerapps, there wasnt a lot of online documentation and tutorials on how to use it as its a new service and hardly anyone uses it. As a computer science student, it wouldve been better if i coded this app myself, as i couldve gotten more functionality out of it, implmenting a front end app using Swift (for iphone app development), a backend API service (using nodejs or python) and a database (using MYSQl or SQLite). This solution wouldve given us all the capabilities for us to implement all the features we could want. However, this would unrealistic as this would require a lot of development time, a server to run the backend and database on. This would also be the way out of scope of the course, which wouldnt make it fair for non compsci students.

So other than the fact we couldn't get our app fully functioning, it was a fun assignment as i got to play aorund with UI and UX components of the app. 
My group worked well together, but me and Ethan did most of the app development as we were most comfortable making adjustments and were the most technical in the group.
