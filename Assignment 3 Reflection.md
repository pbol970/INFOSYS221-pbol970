# INFOSYS 221 Assignment 3 Reflection
<p>
I found this assignment really confusing. most of the questions for the cloud services section werent clear on what they wanted.
Most of them were yes or no questions, which made it easy.
But the fact that this assignment is worth more than assignment 2, which was snake and ladders, is really weird, and this assignment took less time to complete.
  
for the first section however, i found that relitivly straight forward. I found a list of API's that didnt require any auth keys, and used JSFiddle to write the code to access the api and print each item in the array.
