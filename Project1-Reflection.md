## Project 1

<p> 
  I found it relevilvey straight forward. I enjoyed the given the template as it made it easy as to what to write and how to complete each section. 
  
  My group mates responded in a timely manner. But it was a little difficult at the start to contact them, because not everyone checks their uni email on a daily          basis. however i did manage to contact on of my members through the zoom chat during a lecture. but if he didt attend the lecture, it wouldnt be as easy.
  
  This part of the project was straight forward, and didnt made me realise I didnt need to study more about certain topics or sections.
