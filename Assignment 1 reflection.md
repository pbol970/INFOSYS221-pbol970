<p>
I found this assignment reletivily straight forward. I did have to familierise myself with the pseudo code keywords and how to properly format my pseudo code.
However, once I knew all the keywords and the format/structure of pseudo code, i found it straight forward to complete. 
  
From this assignment, I learnt how to write pseudo code and how to break down a problem into its individual components.

I didnt have any major problems with this assignment. 

This assignment took me
